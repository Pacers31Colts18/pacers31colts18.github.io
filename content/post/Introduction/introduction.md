Welcome to my new blog! My name is Joe Loveless, and I've been working in the Endpoint space for over 12 years now. I currently live in Minnesota, attend TCSMUG user group sessions when time alows, try to go to MMSMOA yearly and love working and playing with technology. I'm a dad of two kids, own some chickens, and 3 dogs. My goal of this blog is to just provide content like others have done for me and to give back!

I plan on writing about the following:

- Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft ConfigMgr
- Active Directory
- Group Policy
- PowerShell
- Other ramblings
