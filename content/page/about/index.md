My name is Joe Loveless.  I've been working in the endpoint management space for the last ten years with a focus on endpoint configuration tools including Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Configuration Manager, Group Policy, PowerShell, and probably some other tools I am forgetting. I currently live in Wells, MN a tiny town near the border of Iowa and Minnesota. Originally I am from Mooresville, IN but moved up to the Minnesota area around 2018. I currently work for MNIT Services for the State of Minnesota. **All opinions and thoughts on this website are strictly my own.**

I started this blog in 2025, previous to that I believe I attempted one around 2018. Before that, I always had an interest in websites. I used to run an Indiana Pacers blog around 2014ish (PacersCenter.com), and in high school would run websites for either our high school or my pro wrestling fandom.

I would love if you subscribed to my [blog's RSS feed](htts://joeloveless.com/index.xml). I'm also on various social media channels (links on the left) and you can find me on the [WinAdmins.io Discord channel](https://winadmins.io/)

**Work Background**

Growing up, it seemed we always had a computer around. I don't remember the model, but I remember the first house we lived in having one when I was around 4 years old (born in 1985). I remember the Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune games. From there and moving to Mooresville, I was big into DOOM, MadDog McCree, SimCity, and NBA Live games along with what was offered in school (Oregon Trail and some fishing game).

I started really dabbling in technology in high school, attending a vocational school part-time for Computer Repair and Networking. From there, I took an internship with the vocational school (Wayne Township Schools in Indianapolis), doing everything you can imagine. Running networking cables, upgrading labs to Windows XP with Ghost, T1 troubleshooting, break/fix work, inventorying. Anything the System Administrators wanted to hand off, they did. It was a great learning experience.

Not knowing what to do with my life, I enrolled at Ball State University for 1.5 years before dropping out. I wasn't motivated, didn't know what to do, and my parents didn't want to pay for me to f around anymore. I came back home, worked some odd jobs, did security camera systems for a year or so.

In 2005, I enrolled at Ivy Tech Community College in Indianapolis, while working for a bottled water/water softener salt delivery company at the same time. I found that if I took 9 credit hours max + tacked on any grants or scholarships, I could come out with around 200 dollars in my pocket each semester. In 2011, I finally graduated with an Associates Degree in Computer Information Technology.

My first "real" IT job was with a software company in Indianapolis. My sister-in-law previously worked there, before passing away from pneumonia/H1N1 related illness. The president of the company offered me a Quality Assurance position. I was to test the software manually on random versions of Server (2003/2008/2008 R2) and Desktop (7, Vista, XP) and various MFDs. I lasted a year there, but learned a lot. My boss would randomly curse me out and throw chairs against the wall. Not a place to be.

From there, I took a Desktop Support position at Indiana University (IUPUI) and absolutely loved my time there. I worked for the medical schools, and we grew a ton in my time there. When I started, I only supported the School of Dentistry. In my five years at IU, that grew to centralization with the School of Medicine, Optometry, Regenstrief Institute and others before finally being gobbled up into UITS.

I was eventually promoted to Systems Administrator at IU, where I was handed SCCM and JAMF as others were walking out the door. Seems to be a common theme for CM Administrators?

I learned a lot in my time at IU, but was growing stagnant and bored. I then took at job with a law firm in Minneapolis. I worked there for a year. I probably shouldn't have stayed there as long as I did. On day 1, my hiring manager was fired and they did a re-org of the company. Being an endpoint administrator, I was merged in to a dept with Exchange, conference room technology, endpoint technology, print services, etc. I got to support endpoint technology + print services, and then when on call, always had a random Exchange outage. Stressful times. They merged with another law firm with a bigger endpoint team, so I was starting to see the writing.

In 2019, I moved to MNIT Services as a Group Policy Administrator. I've been here going on six years, and am now the Sr. Endpoint Configuration and Automation Engineer working with a group of 7 insanely talented configuration, automation, and provisioning engineers.

**Personal Background**

I'm a father of two kids (age 14 and 12), married to a beautiful wife since 2010, and have three dogs, six chickens, and five acres of land. We previously had two pigs (1 died, 1 slaughtered), 2 goats (eventually sold), 15 chickens (random deaths, hawks). The Indiana Pacers are my favorite sports team, but I also like the Indianapolis Colts, Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Wild. I play video games when there is free time, and read some books, but not enough.
