What I really mean by up north is past the Twin Cities. I've also started yet another project, trying to finish the drywall mudding in my office/loft above the garage.

Seems silly to me. Unfortunately, I am not a graphic artist. I tried that route when I was about 19 and found out quickly that it wasn't for me (aka I sucked at it) at Ivy Tech Community College.
