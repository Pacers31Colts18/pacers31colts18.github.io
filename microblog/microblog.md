Sorry for all the quick posts here. Testing GitHub Actions for a posse method of posting to social media. GitHub Action was failing, but it was still posting. Will need to refine this some for BlueSky, but hope to have a blog post about it soon. This year I'm about taking back control of my data and media. While social media is still valuable, what happens if Mastodon or BlueSky turn into another cesspool that we want to migrate off of? I was reading about the POSSE method, this will allow me to post from a "microblog" on my site, and have it go everywhere else.

This is my first microblog post.

It supports images, threading, and multiple paragraphs.
